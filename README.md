# ELL-Machine-Learning

## Overview

This was the final project for my Machine Learning class.  I worked with one other person to compete in the [Feedback Prize - English Language Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-english-language-learning) competition hosted by Vanderbilt University and The Learning Agency Lab on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

### Goals

<ul>
  <li>Improve automated language assessment tools for English Language Learners (ELLs)</li>
  <li>Train a model to accurately assess the language proficiency of English Language Learners (ELLs) in 8th-12th grade using their essays</li>
</ul>

### Training Dataset

There were roughly 3,900 essays in the provided training dataset with a median word count of about 400 words.  Each essay had six scores on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0 in the following categories: cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions.  We had to train a model to predict the score of each category for a given essay.

### Models Tried

<ul>
  <li>Ridge Regression</li>
  <li>ElasticNet</li>
  <li>Lasso</li>
  <li>Random Forest Regressor</li>
  <li>Gradient Boosing Regressor</li>
  <li>Pytorch Neural Network</li>
</ul>
